## Key Changes

### Manage Technicians

- **Password Hashing**:
  - Technician passwords are now securely hashed using `password_hash()` before being stored in the database.
  - This enhancement ensures that plain-text passwords are never stored, significantly improving security.

- **Improved Validation**:
  - Introduced both client-side and server-side validation for passwords.
  - Passwords must now meet strict criteria: a minimum of 8 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
  - This ensures that all technician accounts are secured with strong passwords.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Enhanced error logging for easier debugging and maintenance.
  - User-friendly error messages guide administrators when input does not meet validation criteria or when unexpected errors occur.

- **CSRF Protection**:
  - Implemented CSRF tokens in forms to prevent unauthorized or malicious form submissions.
  - This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that form actions are performed intentionally by authenticated users.

- **Session Security**:
  - Regenerated session IDs after sensitive operations to prevent session fixation attacks.
  - Ensured that session variables are properly managed and cleared when no longer needed.

## Additional Information

- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Backend**: PHP (with Object-Oriented Programming principles)
  - **Database**: MySQL (accessed via PDO)
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS


- **Security Considerations**:
- **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` before storage.
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users (e.g., admins) can perform sensitive operations like adding or deleting records.
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error logs are maintained for debugging while generic error messages are shown to users to prevent information leakage.
